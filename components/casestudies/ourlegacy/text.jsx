            I attended a workshop together with digital agency Aino in
            Gothenburg and did a redesign on the swedish clothing brand Our
            legacy. I wanted to make a clean, minimalistic and functional design
            where the clothes would speak for them self. Inspired by the classic
            notebook I choose a blue ink color and designed the navigation as an
            archive.
          </p>
        </TextBlock>
      </TextBox>
    </>
  );
};

export default Text;
