            So let's wrap everything up, this is the app. Nothing spectacular by
            any means but give the interactions a try and imagine how it would
            look completely static.
            <br /> <br /> If you are nerdy like me and want to know what I used
            to make this it was made with React, Framer motion, styled
            components and some good ol' fashion CSS. If you come this far,
            thank you for reading and I hope you learned a little something
            about micro-interactions.
