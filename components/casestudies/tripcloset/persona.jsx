            <p>
              To better understand how to design for users who are constantly
              traveling and are in need of clothing, User Personas were created.
              Below is a brief version of Michael's persona, who is made up by
              combining all of my interviewees. He was used to understand a user
              who would care more about renting clothes instead of buying new
              ones for a short period of time.
