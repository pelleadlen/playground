Below is a brief version of Michael's persona, who is made up by combining all of my interviewees. He was used to understand a user who would care more about renting clothes instead of buying new ones for a short period of time."

I made a Design System in Figma, and I ensured it would pass the contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. For hierarchy in the typography I used shades of gray and for elevation I used overlays to make primary CTA's stand out more."

        text="This project was really fun to work on. I learned a lot and especially about the importance of user testing and learning from my mistakes. As a user experience designer, Iâ€™m always looking for new tools to make my design process better. For the user testing I did a deep dive into Maze. An amazing app that makes it easy to get quick feedback from real people. And for prototyping, I used Protopie where I could implement some logic into the onboarding process which was important during the testings. If you like this idea â€” let's make it!"
